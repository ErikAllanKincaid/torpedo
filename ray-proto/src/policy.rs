//! Coordinator-suggested firewall rules, distributed in the signed `GroupBlob`.
//!
//! These types are the single authoritative shape for a trusted network's
//! suggested firewall: they ride in the blob, cross the IPC boundary
//! ([`crate::ipc::IpcMessage::FirewallSuggest`]), and are what a `ray apply`
//! spec deserializes into. They are deliberately keyed by **hostname**, so an
//! admin can author rules before any host has joined; each node materializes
//! the rules targeting its own hostname, resolving peer hostnames to identities
//! from the same blob's member list.
//!
//! [`BTreeMap`] keys give a canonical (sorted) serialization, so the blob hash
//! is stable regardless of authoring order.
