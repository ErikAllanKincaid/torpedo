# torpedo — implementation design notes

Fork of rayfish (`upstream` remote, commit `9e142411`) making the overlay IPv4
subnet configurable so the node can run alongside an active Tailscale client,
plus a rebrand of this fork's own identity. Requirements/constraints are in
`spec/design_spec.py` (libspec); this file records the *how* and, importantly,
the two places where implementation reality forced a documented extension of the
original proposal (`SPEC_PROPOSAL_rayfish_fork.md`).

## Subnet representation

- In-memory type is `Option<(Ipv4Addr, u8)>` (base address + prefix length),
  exactly as SUBNET-001 specifies. `None` means "default", i.e. `100.64.0.0/10`,
  preserving today's behavior for the no-flag case.
- On the wire / on disk it is serialized as a **CIDR string** (e.g.
  `"10.88.0.0/16"`) via the shared `membership::cidr_opt` serde helper. This is
  required because `AppConfig` is TOML and a `(Ipv4Addr, u8)` tuple would be an
  illegal heterogeneous TOML array; using one string representation everywhere
  (GroupBlob msgpack included) keeps it uniform and human-readable.
- Helpers in `membership.rs`: `default_subnet()`, `resolve_subnet(opt)`,
  `subnet_host_mask(prefix)`, `subnet_netmask(prefix)`, `subnet_gateway(subnet)`.
  All host-bit / netmask / gateway math derives from a single `prefix` so the
  three can never disagree (the one place SUBNET-003 flags for care).

## Where the subnet lives (source of truth vs. operative cache)

- **`GroupBlob.subnet` (source of truth, SUBNET-001).** The signed, network-wide
  record every peer fetches and validates against. Carried in
  `canonical_group_bytes` / `group_blob_hash` so it is part of the signed bytes,
  and read back in `decode_group_blob` to validate member IPs against the
  network's own subnet.
- **`NetworkState.subnet`** mirrors the active network's resolved subnet so the
  daemon call sites (`assign_ip`, tiebreak, publish) have it without re-decoding.

### Documented extension #1 — `AppConfig.subnet` (node-level operative cache)

The proposal (§3.1) says to put the subnet on `GroupBlob` and warns against
`NetworkConfig`. That is correct for the *source of truth*, but it is not
sufficient on its own, because of an architectural fact the proposal did not
account for:

> The node has exactly **one** overlay IP and **one** TUN device, created once
> at daemon bootstrap (`bootstrap.rs`) from `identity.local_ip()` — before any
> `create`/`join` has chosen a network. For the node's TUN and derived IP to
> actually land in a custom subnet (the whole point — avoiding Tailscale's
> `100.64.0.0/10`), the subnet must be known at **bootstrap** time, not only at
> create time.

So the node's operative subnet is cached in `AppConfig.subnet` (node-global, not
per-`NetworkConfig`, so it is not the thing §3.1 warned against). `create
--subnet` and `join` write it; bootstrap reads it to build the
`IrohIdentityProvider` and TUN in the right subnet. `GroupBlob.subnet` remains
the authoritative network-wide value; `AppConfig.subnet` is a local read-through
cache of it. This keeps SUBNET-001 intact while making the fork actually work.

Consequence for the live test (Phase 7): a node picks up a newly-chosen subnet
for its TUN at the next daemon bootstrap. `create --subnet` persists it and
re-derives the creator's own IP in that subnet for the roster/blob immediately;
the single shared TUN reflects it after the daemon (re)starts. This is an
accepted limitation for a personal-test fork and is noted here rather than
papered over.

## IrohIdentityProvider

Gains a `subnet: (Ipv4Addr, u8)` field, set at construction (bootstrap reads it
from `AppConfig.subnet`, default otherwise). `local_ip()` and the trait
`derive_ip(&self, peer)` derive into that subnet, so the three trait call sites
(accept/join/create_join) need no signature change.

## Pure-function threading (SUBNET-003/004/005/007/008)

`derive_ip`, `derive_ip_with_index`, `assign_ip`, `is_reserved_ipv4`,
`validate_member`, `validate_approved`, `ensure_in_cgnat_range`,
`resolve_ip_tiebreak` all take an explicit `subnet: (Ipv4Addr, u8)`. No hidden
global. Test call sites pass `default_subnet()`.

## Conflict check (SUBNET-006)

`check_cgnat_conflict()` + `is_cgnat()` (tun.rs), its call at `bootstrap.rs`, and
the `use` in `daemon/mod.rs` are all removed. A fork deliberately choosing a
subnet outside `100.64.0.0/10` has nothing for this check to protect against, and
it is what currently refuses to start next to Tailscale.

## tun::create (SUBNET-005) and DNS (SUBNET-007/008)

- `tun::create` takes the subnet, computes netmask from `subnet_netmask(prefix)`
  and gateway from `subnet_gateway`, replacing the hardcoded `(255,192,0,0)` and
  `100.64.0.1`.
- `MAGIC_DNS_V4` becomes a function of the configured subnet (an offset within
  it) instead of the fixed `100.100.100.53`; assumes `/24` or larger.
- The PTR/reverse-lookup NXDOMAIN range check mirrors `ensure_in_cgnat_range`.
- The macOS branch of `route_peer_range` is left untouched (out of scope; Linux
  only per the proposal).

### Documented extension #2 — reconcile.py MAGIC_DNS grep

`MAGIC_DNS_V4` moves out of a literal into subnet-relative math, so the only
`100.100.100.x` / `100.64.0.0` literals remaining in the touched files are the
`default_subnet()` definition (written `100, 64, 0, 0`, comma form — does not
match reconcile.py's dotted-literal regex) and doc comments containing the
allowed `100.64.0.0/10` substring. CON-002 stays green.

## Rename (RENAME-001..004)

Per §4.1, leaving §4.2 (relay preset, cosmetic metric/trace labels) untouched.
Details tracked in the RENAME-* requirements and verified against the diff.
