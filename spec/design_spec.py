# Specification for the `torpedo` fork of rayfish: make the overlay IPv4 subnet
# configurable at network-creation time instead of hardcoded to 100.64.0.0/10,
# and rebrand this fork's own identity (binary/service/paths/ALPN) away from
# rayfish so its traffic can never be confused with genuine rayfish traffic.
#
# libspec v9 note: each class's OWN docstring is what gets compiled into a
# stored component (base-class Jinja templates such as {{req_id}} are not
# inherited into a subclass docstring, because Python docstrings do not
# inherit). So each requirement/constraint ID is embedded literally in the
# first line of its docstring to stay visible and code-cross-referenceable,
# while req_id/constraint_id/enforcement_logic are also kept as class
# attributes for programmatic access (e.g. reconcile.py documentation).

    already-active Tailscale client on the same host.

    Priority: high.
    User journey: create a network with a custom --subnet -> join it from a
    second machine also running Tailscale -> both machines reach each other over
    the fork's mesh while Tailscale keeps working unaffected on both.
    Acceptance: `torpedo create --subnet <cidr>` succeeds on a host with an
    active Tailscale client; a second host joins successfully; `torpedo status`
    on both shows a live peer; Tailscale connectivity is unaffected throughout.

    name, `ray`, hardcoded directly into ~40 LIVE, reachable, user-facing
    strings: CLI hint text, error messages, an IPC response message, a printed
    YAML example, the `torpedo version` banner, and shell-completion
    registration. A user following any of these would try to run a binary that
    does not exist on a torpedo install. Found via live two-machine testing
    (`torpedo version` was directly observed printing `ray 0.1.5 (...)` on the
    first line, `torpedo --version` printing `torpedo 0.1.5 (...)` on the
    second — the same binary, two different self-identifications).

    Renamed (literal `ray` -> `torpedo` in each string, no behavior change):
    - `src/main.rs`: the `clap_complete::generate(shell, ..., "ray", ...)` call
      (so `torpedo completions <shell>` registers completions for a command
      name that actually exists); the `Command::Version` println (the
      `ray {FULL_VERSION}` banner); both `config set`/`unset` "restart" hints.
    - `src/cli/status.rs`: `infer_hint`'s three hints (daemon-not-running,
      expired-invite, needs-operator); the inactive-data-plane hint; the
      version-skew hint; all four `print_pending_summary` command hints
      (`firewall pending`, `requests`, `files`, `connections`).
    - `src/cli/network.rs`: the post-`create` invite hint and both `print_next`
      command tables (`ray status`/`ray up`).
    - `src/cli/invite.rs` (join hint, reusable-key hint, admit hint),
      `src/cli/pair.rs` (unpair hint), `src/cli/connect.rs` (approve hint,
      share hint, incompatible-version hint), `src/cli/alias.rs` (identity hint),
      `src/cli/service.rs` (sudo re-run hint), `src/cli/files.rs` (accept hint),
      `src/cli/firewall.rs` (disabled-state hint, invite-missing suggested
      command, alias-identity hint).
    - `src/apply.rs`: the non-YAML error message, and the entire `EXAMPLE_SPEC`
      constant printed by `torpedo apply --example` (also fixes a stray
      "Rayfish deploy spec" mention).
    - `src/onepassword.rs`: the backup item's stored `value` text — this one
      is written verbatim into the user's own 1Password vault item by
      `torpedo pair backup --1password`, so the leak is persisted outside the
      repo entirely until fixed. Also `src/main.rs`'s `pair backup`/`pair
      restore --1password` item **title** default, `"Rayfish Identity"` ->
      `"Torpedo Identity"` (both subcommands, kept identical since restore
      looks up by this default title). This fork is pre-release with no real
      users, so there is no existing backup stored under the old title to
      break; a back-compat lookup is unneeded and was not added.
    - `src/daemon/mod.rs` (operator-grant hint + confirmation message),
      `src/daemon/mesh/runtime.rs` (kick-yourself error), `src/daemon/mesh/
      create_join.rs` (pending-approval message, version-mismatch message),
      `src/daemon/mesh/files.rs` (auto-accept warning, not-your-device error),
      `src/daemon/mesh/firewall.rs` (mesh-SSH no-peer-authorized nudge).
    - `src/lib.rs`: `APP_NAME` corrected from `"ray"` to `"torpedo"`. Dormant
      (grep confirms nothing references this constant), but an exported wrong
      value is exactly the residual-identity class this series targets, and
      the fix is zero-risk since nothing consumes it today.

    Deliberately EXCLUDED (false positives / different `ray` / out of scope):
    - `src/lib.rs`'s `DNS_DOMAIN = "ray"` and every `.ray`-suffixed hostname in
      `src/dns.rs`, `src/dns_resolver.rs`, `src/dns_config.rs` (tests and
      domain-suffix logic) — this is the KEEP-ON-PURPOSE `.ray` Magic-DNS TLD,
      an unrelated "ray".
    - `src/network_name.rs`'s hostname-generator wordlist entry `"ray"` —
      the English word (as in stingray), coincidental, part of a list with
      "reed", "pond", "quay".
    - `src/update.rs`'s `release_asset_name` (`ray-{os}-{arch}`) and the
      matching literals in `src/main.rs` (`ray-linux-x86_64` etc.) — these name
      **upstream's own** release asset filenames (self-update, gated off by
      CON-006, still points `REPO_SLUG` at `rayfish/rayfish` on purpose);
      renaming would make a hypothetical re-enabled updater look for an asset
      that does not exist in upstream's releases.
    - Every other user-facing string inside `cli/update.rs` past its
      `SELF_UPDATE_ENABLED` early-return (confirmed unreachable in this fork's
      shipped behavior — `cmd_update` returns before reaching any of them).
    - Source comments and doc-comments (`//`, `///`, `//!`) mentioning `ray
      <verb>` — not user-facing, matches the cosmetic carve-out RENAME-009
      already established; left for a later opportunistic pass, not this one.

    No new Constraint: unlike CON-007's curated host-artifact tokens (which
    never appear in comments or dead code), a token-count gate here would
    false-fail on the deliberately-untouched comments and the dead
    `cli/update.rs` tail, which still contain `ray <verb>` after this change.
    Verified by reading the diff, same as RENAME-006..009.

    When torpedo has to manage /etc/resolv.conf directly (the tier-5

    NetworkManager, resolvectl, or resolvconf backend is present — the common
    case on a default Debian trixie server / minimal install), `sudo torpedo up`
    MUST surface a user-visible warning, not merely a daemon-side log line. The
    prior behavior logged the takeover at INFO to /var/log/torpedo, so the user
    discovered the change only by noticing that their resolv.conf had been
    rewritten (reported in the field against upstream).

    The warning rides the EXISTING `activate()` `warnings` channel (returned in
    the `Up` IPC Ok message and rendered by `torpedo up`), so no IPC wire change
    is needed. Its text names the backup path (/etc/resolv.conf.before-torpedo)
    and the restore path (`torpedo down` / `sudo torpedo uninstall`) so the
    notice is actionable, not alarming. Implemented as a
    `DnsConfigurator::user_warning()` trait method: default None (split-DNS

class NoMutualDnsForwardingLoopWithTailscale(Requirement):
    """REQUIREMENT-ID: DNS-003

    CRITICAL, TOP PRIORITY — found live in Phase-7 two-machine testing
    (2026-07-08, xps-17-9720). On a tier-5 host (no systemd-resolved,
    NetworkManager, resolvectl, or resolvconf — DirectResolvConf takeover,
    same class of host DNS-001 covers) running Tailscale, torpedo and
    Tailscale form a MUTUAL DNS FORWARDING LOOP that breaks ALL DNS
    resolution system-wide — not just `.ray` names, ALL of it, including the
    torpedo daemon's own outbound HTTP (pkarr discovery). This directly
    defeats the fork's entire reason to exist: coexisting with Tailscale.

    SYMPTOMS (all observed live on xps-17-9720, a minimal Debian-trixie-family
    host, LMDE, with Tailscale active):
    - `torpedo join <invite>` fails immediately: "failed to resolve network
      record: failed to resolve network record: Service 'pkarr' failed".
    - Direct queries to EITHER resolver hang for the full timeout and return
      nothing: `dig @100.100.100.100 github.com` (Tailscale's quad-100) and
      `dig @10.99.100.53 github.com` (torpedo's magic resolver, subnet-derived)
      both time out. Critically, `dig @10.99.100.53 <anything>.ray` answers
      correctly and instantly (NXDOMAIN + SOA, 0ms) — torpedo's local `.ray`
      answering path and its TUN-interception plumbing are NOT the bug.
    - `ping -c1 github.com` on the host: "Temporary failure in name
      resolution" — total outbound DNS failure, confirmed independent of any
      particular application.
    - Raw ICMP to both `100.100.100.100` and `10.99.100.53` succeeds fine
      (sub-millisecond) as both root and non-root — the network/routing path
      is healthy; this is a DNS-application-layer bug, not connectivity.
    - `journalctl -u tailscaled` shows, at the exact moment of failure:
      `dns udp query: waiting for response or error from [10.99.100.53]:
      context deadline exceeded` and `dns udp query: request queue full`
      (with hundreds of queries dropped under `[RATELIMIT]`) — i.e.
      Tailscale's own DNS proxy is ALSO stuck waiting on torpedo's resolver.

    DIAGNOSIS (root cause, confirmed via `/etc/resolv.conf.before-torpedo`,
    the daemon's own capture log, and the interleaved torpedo/tailscaled
    journal):
    1. Before torpedo ran, `/etc/resolv.conf` was Tailscale's own file:
       `nameserver 100.100.100.100` (this is the literal content of the
       `.before-torpedo` backup — confirmed).
    2. `DirectResolvConf::new()` (src/dns_config.rs) reads that file BEFORE
       overwriting it and correctly captures `100.100.100.100` as the sole
       upstream via `parse_resolv_nameservers` (also confirmed via the
       daemon's own `took over /etc/resolv.conf directly … upstreams=
       [100.100.100.100]` log line, present at every one of several restarts
       in this test run). torpedo's capture step is NOT the bug — it also
       already excludes its own magic IP from a captured upstream list
       (`parse_resolv_nameservers` filters `crate::dns::magic_dns_v4_node()`),
       so torpedo correctly guards against looping to itself on re-takeover.
    3. `DirectResolvConf::apply()` then overwrites `/etc/resolv.conf` to point
       solely at torpedo's own magic resolver IP (`10.99.100.53`, subnet-
       derived).
    4. `tailscaled` ITSELF watches `/etc/resolv.conf` to learn where to
       forward queries its own quad-100 resolver can't answer (the same
       "watch resolv.conf for the real upstream" design torpedo uses,
       independently implemented). Once torpedo rewrites the file, tailscaled
       adopts torpedo's magic IP (`10.99.100.53`) as ITS OWN upstream —
       tailscaled has no way to know that IP belongs to another VPN's
       self-referential resolver, so it has no equivalent guard.
    5. Net effect, a perfect two-hop loop with no real exit: an app's query
       hits `10.99.100.53` (torpedo, the OS's sole nameserver) -> torpedo
       does not recognize the name as `.ray` -> forwards to its captured
       upstream `100.100.100.100` (Tailscale) -> Tailscale's quad-100 also
       does not recognize the name -> forwards to ITS captured upstream,
       `10.99.100.53` -> back to torpedo. Neither side ever reaches the real
       internet; each side's own timeout eventually fires (torpedo's
       `forward_once`, 3s; tailscaled's own deadline), which is exactly the
       observed hang-then-timeout behavior, not an instant error.

    WHY THIS WAS NOT CAUGHT ON THE COORDINATOR (AORUS, tier-1): AORUS has
    systemd-resolved, so torpedo took the D-Bus split-DNS registration path
    (`configured systemd-resolved via D-Bus for .ray`) instead of touching
    `/etc/resolv.conf` at all, and Tailscale itself very likely also registers
    with systemd-resolved there rather than writing the file directly — so
    there is no file for the two to collide over. This loop is specific to
    hosts where BOTH torpedo and Tailscale independently fall back to direct
    `/etc/resolv.conf` management (tier-5, this fork's own DNS-001 scenario) —
    which, per DNS-001's own framing, is not a rare edge case: it is "the
    common case on a default Debian trixie server / minimal install", i.e.
    exactly the kind of host an operator would run a lean VPN mesh on.

    IMPACT: on any tier-5 host running Tailscale, `sudo torpedo up` silently
    breaks ALL system DNS (not just `.ray`), including torpedo's own ability
    to join a network (pkarr discovery needs working DNS to resolve
    `dns.iroh.link`). This is a total, silent failure of the fork's headline
    coexistence promise on a documented-common host class, not a cosmetic bug.

    NOT YET FIXED — left open deliberately for focused design work (this
    docstring is diagnostic, not prescriptive). Candidate directions worth
    weighing, none chosen yet: detect that Tailscale is active (e.g. a
    `tailscale0` interface or `100.100.100.100` present in the pre-takeover
    resolv.conf) and refuse the direct takeover / warn loudly instead of
    proceeding blind; special-case known other-VPN quad-resolver IPs
    (`100.100.100.100`) by never handing them out as a captured upstream
    that could loop back; or (a smaller, more surgical option) detect the
    specific loop pattern at forward time (a query that bounces back to
    ourselves) and fail fast with a clear error instead of a silent hang.

    ENFORCEMENT: none yet (no fix designed or landed). Add a unit test once a
    fix direction is chosen; this is exactly the kind of interaction bug a
    single-process unit test cannot catch on its own (it requires a second,
    real DNS-proxying daemon), so integration-level verification (a live
    two-machine re-test with Tailscale + a tier-5 host) is the real gate.

class ForeignOverlayUpstreamLoopBreaker(Requirement):
    """REQUIREMENT-ID: DNS-004

    The SAFETY NET for the opt-in `magic-dns direct` takeover. The primary
    resolution of DNS-003 is DNS-005, which makes the /etc/resolv.conf takeover
    opt-in so the loop cannot occur by default. This requirement hardens the
    remaining case: a user who explicitly runs `torpedo config set magic-dns
    direct` on a tier-5 host that ALSO runs Tailscale. Without it, that opt-in
    would re-expose the mutual torpedo<->Tailscale DNS forwarding loop of
    DNS-003. Two decoupled mechanisms plus housekeeping.

    (1) LOOP-BREAKER — never adopt a foreign overlay VPN's resolver as our
    upstream. `parse_resolv_nameservers` (src/dns_config.rs) already drops our
    OWN magic IP; extend the same filter to drop EVERY address in the whole
    CGNAT / shared range 100.64.0.0/10 (RFC 6598). That range is where overlay
    VPNs park self-referential stub resolvers (Tailscale's 100.100.100.100, and
    the LEGACY rayfish magic 100.100.100.53 from before this fork moved the
    default subnet to 10.88.0.0/16) — a genuine recursive resolver essentially
    never lives there. A captured 100.64/10 address is precisely the poison that
    forms the loop, so refusing to forward to it breaks the loop at the source.

    This is deliberately NOT gated on "NetworkManager in default DNS mode" (an
    early candidate). That signal is wrong twice over: it MISSES the pure no-NM
    tier-5 host (minimal Debian netinst on ifupdown+dhclient or systemd-networkd
    without resolved), which DNS-001 itself calls "the common case" and which
    loops identically; and it is unnecessary, because the filter is already
    scoped to the only risky path (captured_upstreams() is non-empty ONLY in
    DirectResolvConf — every split-DNS backend returns empty) AND self-gates by
    content (it does nothing unless a 100.64/10 address is actually present,
    which only happens when a foreign overlay poisoned resolv.conf). On a normal
    tier-5 host with a real router (e.g. 192.168.1.1) and no Tailscale it is a
    no-op. Every drop is logged so an operator can see it happened.

    (2) REAL-UPSTREAM RECOVERY — the loop-breaker alone converts a hang into a
    failure (on a Tailscale-first-then-torpedo host the captured set was ONLY
    100.100.100.100, so after the filter it is empty and non-`.ray` DNS dies).
    To restore working internet DNS, recover the genuine upstream, in priority:
      (a) config `dns_upstreams` if the operator set it (already honored via
          config::resolve_upstreams, applied before recovery runs);
      (b) IMPLEMENTED: a coexisting overlay's own pre-takeover backup file —
          Tailscale's /etc/resolv.pre-tailscale-backup.conf, where it stashes the
          true DHCP upstream (on the repro host it held `nameserver 192.168.1.1`);
          read by dns_config::recover_real_upstreams() and parsed with the SAME
          100.64/10 exclusion so a poisoned backup can never re-introduce the loop.
      (c) DEFERRED: NetworkManager's DHCP-learned nameservers via D-Bus (the
          physical NIC's Ip4Config.Nameservers — unpoisoned even while Tailscale
          owns resolv.conf, since tailscale0 is unmanaged; NM detection as a
          SOURCE, not a gate on (1)). A more general source than (b) but more
          code; the backup-file source already covers the Tailscale repro, so NM
          D-Bus is a follow-up if a no-Tailscale-backup host ever needs it.
      (d) if still empty, DO NOT silently egress to a public resolver: leave
          non-`.ray` unresolved and surface a clear warning naming
          `torpedo config set dns-upstreams <ip>` (reuses the DNS-001 warnings
          channel). A public default may later be an explicit opt-in, never the
          silent fallback.
    Wired in DnsManager::configure: only when is_direct && the resolved upstream
    set is empty. Result (VERIFIED LIVE on xps + Tailscale, `magic-dns direct`):
    no loop, `github.com` resolves via torpedo->192.168.1.1, `.ray` resolves
    locally, tailscaled shows zero `deadline exceeded`/`queue full`.

    KNOWN LIMITATION of `direct` on a Tailscale host (verified: NXDOMAIN): while
    torpedo owns resolv.conf it is the SOLE nameserver and forwards non-`.ray`
    queries to the real router, which does not know `.ts.net` — so Tailscale's own
    MagicDNS names stop resolving system-wide (Tailscale itself still answers when
    queried directly at 100.100.100.100). `direct` therefore trades `.ts.net` for
    `.ray`. Recovering BOTH needs the deferred `.ts.net`->Tailscale forwarding
    (below), or the clean answer: run systemd-resolved so both VPNs take the
    split-DNS path and neither seizes resolv.conf.

    (3) HOUSEKEEPING — purge stale `100.100.100.53` literals that misdocument
    torpedo's own resolver as the legacy /10-derived address instead of the
    subnet-derived magic_dns_v4_node() (10.88.100.53 on the default subnet):
    done in src/dns_config.rs (module doc, the two direct-mode comments, and the
    resolv_conf_is_ours test fixture). Cosmetic but prevents a reader from
    trusting a wrong resolver IP.

    DEFERRED (v2): special-case `.ts.net` (and the tailnet reverse zones) to
    forward to 100.100.100.100 instead of the router, which would restore
    Tailscale MagicDNS under `direct` with no loop (Tailscale is authoritative for
    its own zone, so it answers rather than re-forwarding). Not done in v1 — the
    `direct` path is opt-in and the clean recommendation is systemd-resolved.
    NON-GOAL: actively reconfiguring Tailscale itself.

    ENFORCEMENT: unit tests (reconcile.py's `test` check) — is_overlay_resolver
    matches the whole 100.64/10 range and nothing else; parse_resolv_nameservers
    drops ALL 100.64/10 addresses (100.100.100.100 and 100.100.100.53) while
    keeping a real router IP (192.168.1.1). recover_real_upstreams (file read) and
    the true two-daemon loop are not unit-testable in-process (per DNS-003), so a
    live xps + Tailscale re-test in `magic-dns direct` remains the integration gate.

class MagicDnsIsOptInNeverSeizesResolvConf(Requirement):
    """REQUIREMENT-ID: DNS-005

    THE PRIMARY resolution of DNS-003: torpedo does not touch /etc/resolv.conf by
    default. Magic DNS (`.ray` name resolution) is a convenience, not a
    requirement — the mesh data plane, firewall, embedded SSH, and file transfer
    never use system DNS, the `torpedo` CLI resolves hostnames daemon-side from
    the roster, and `torpedo status` already lists every peer's mesh IP (its own
    IP on each network header + an ipv4 column per peer row). So an operator can
    reach every host by mesh IP (or a one-time ~/.ssh/config alias) with no OS-DNS
    changes at all. Seizing /etc/resolv.conf to answer `.ray` is exactly what
    collides with another VPN that manages the same file (Tailscale) and produces
    the DNS-003 blackhole — so it must never be the default.

    MECHANISM: a node-global setting `magic_dns: MagicDnsMode` in settings.toml
    (config.rs), three values, set via `torpedo config set magic-dns off|auto|direct`:
      - `off`   — never configure OS DNS at all; DnsManager::configure returns
                  early. Pure mesh-IP operation.
      - `auto`  — DEFAULT. Use a CLEAN split-DNS backend if present
                  (systemd-resolved / NetworkManager dnsmasq / resolvconf — all
                  cooperative, none collide with another VPN); if only the direct
                  /etc/resolv.conf takeover remains, DECLINE it and surface a
                  plain-English notice (dns_config::magic_dns_declined_notice)
                  naming the two ways to enable `.ray`: install systemd-resolved,
                  or `magic-dns direct`.
      - `direct`— additionally permit the /etc/resolv.conf takeover as a last
                  resort (the pre-existing behavior), now guarded by DNS-004's
                  loop-breaker. Opt-in only.
    detect_and_configure(tun_name, allow_direct) returns Option<Box<dyn
    DnsConfigurator>>: Some(clean backend) is always used when present; the direct
    fallback is constructed only when allow_direct (i.e. mode == direct);
    otherwise Ok(None) => the decline notice. `off` short-circuits before
    detection. The cooperative backends are UNCHANGED — this only removes the
    unconditional DirectResolvConf fallback from the default path.

    WHY THIS IS THE RIGHT DEFAULT (field topology): the tier-5 host in the repro
    is the workstation (xps-17, LMDE trixie, NM in default DNS mode), the tier-1
    clean host is the headless server (AORUS, systemd-resolved). On a workstation
    the user does want `.ray`, but the safe default is still hands-off: it never
    blackholes DNS, and the workstation user can either install systemd-resolved
    (moves to the clean path both torpedo and Tailscale share) or opt into
    `magic-dns direct`. Users who love Magic DNS keep it — for free on any host
    with a clean backend (`auto` just works there, e.g. AORUS), or via the opt-in
    on a minimal host.

    ENFORCEMENT: unit tests (reconcile.py's `test` check) — MagicDnsMode::default
    is Auto and !allows_direct; parse/set/get roundtrip incl. reset-on-empty and
    rejection of a bad mode; persistence across save/load. The decline-vs-takeover
    branch and the true two-daemon coexistence are integration-verified by the
    live xps + Tailscale re-test (per DNS-003).

    `Created`/`Joined` IPC responses now carry an optional `warning`; the CLI
    prints it when the chosen subnet != the live TUN subnet ("subnet B/P takes
    effect after `sudo torpedo restart`"). The pure helper is
    `membership::subnet_change_warning`.

    (2) `config get` as a non-root user cannot read the 0600 root:root
    settings.toml (it holds contact_secret_key, so its perms must NOT be relaxed),
    so config::load() silently returned defaults and misreported e.g. `subnet` as
    <default> while the node ran on 10.99. `config get` now detects the unreadable
    file and errors with a "re-run with sudo" hint instead of a wrong value;
    `sudo torpedo config get` shows the real value. Full read-via-daemon IPC is a
    deferred follow-up.

    A CLOSED (invite-gated) network is a trusted mesh, so inbound from it defaults
    to ALLOW: connectivity is open like a normal LAN and the host service's own

    firewall rule per service. OPEN networks keep the secure deny-inbound default —
    a stranger who joins must be explicitly allowed.

    Mechanism: an `allow in any` rule scoped to the network (RuleOrigin::ClosedDefault
    / firewall::closed_default_rule), appended at the BACK so any explicit rule —
    including a deny — overrides it. SharedFirewall::set_closed_default(net, on)

    CREATES a closed (Restricted) network or JOINS one with an invite/reusable key

    replaces RuleOrigin::Network suggestion rules) never touches it.

    v1 limitation: members do not yet learn a network's mode from the signed blob,
    so the trigger is LOCAL knowledge (created-closed / invite-joined). An
    approval-joined closed network, or any open network, gets no rule and stays
    deny — conservative (deny) when the mode is unknown. Propagating the mode in

    """REQUIREMENT-ID: RENAME-012

    Found 2026-07-08 while setting up GitHub Releases so remote test machines
    can fetch a prebuilt binary instead of building from source. `.github/
    workflows/release.yml` and `nightly.yml` were inherited from upstream
    verbatim and never adapted past the binary rename: both packaging steps do
    `BINARY=target/<matrix target>/release/ray`, but this fork's
    `Cargo.toml` renamed the bin target to `torpedo` — the `cp` fails
    ("No such file or directory") the moment either workflow actually runs.
    Fix: `ray` -> `torpedo` in both `Package for release` steps.

    Also renamed for consistency (these are OUR OWN fork's release artifacts,
    downloaded manually since self-update is disabled — see the carve-out
    below for why this is safe): the Linux/macOS asset names
    (`ray-linux-x86_64` -> `torpedo-linux-x86_64`, `ray-linux-aarch64` ->
    `torpedo-linux-aarch64`, `ray-macos-aarch64` -> `torpedo-macos-aarch64`,
    `ray-macos-x86_64` -> `torpedo-macos-x86_64`) and the Android artifact
    (`rayfish-android.apk` -> `torpedo-android.apk`, in both `release.yml` and
    `nightly.yml`). `nightly.yml`'s release-notes body also told users to
    "Install with `ray update --nightly`" — misleading since self-update is
    neutralized in this fork (CON-006) — replaced with a plain
    download-the-asset instruction.

    Deliberately NOT touched (do not "fix" this on a future pass): `src/
    update.rs`'s `release_asset_name` (`ray-{os}-{arch}`) and the matching
    literals in `src/main.rs`, which RENAME-011 already carved out on purpose.
    That code names asset filenames on **upstream's** rayfish/rayfish releases
    (the disabled self-updater's `REPO_SLUG` target, kept per CON-006) — a
    different `ray` than this class's, and renaming it would make a
    hypothetically re-enabled updater look for an asset upstream does not
    publish. This class's renames are entirely on the fork's own
    ErikAllanKincaid/torpedo release assets and do not interact with that code
    path at all.

    (`torpedo-linux-x86_64`, `torpedo-linux-aarch64`) is actually ready to

    - **macOS**: `route_peer_range`/`route_self_loopback` in `src/tun.rs`

    sharper edge because this one is functionally misleading, not just
    cosmetically stale:

    - The vulnerability-reporting link pointed at

    """REQUIREMENT-ID: DOC-001

    Found/fixed 2026-07-08, the two remaining items from TODO.md's doc-fix
    list. Distinct from the `RENAME-*` series: neither of these is stale
    `rayfish` identity, they are plain factual drift between AGENTS.md/
    TESTING.md and the current binary/formula.

    (1) **Hardcoded resolver IP.** AGENTS.md stated the Magic DNS resolver
    address as the fixed literal `100.100.100.53` in four places (the
    KEEP-ON-PURPOSE list, and the `forward.rs`/`dns.rs`/`dns_config.rs` module
    descriptions). Since SUBNET-007/008 this has been subnet-derived
    (`dns::magic_dns_v4`) — `10.88.100.53` on the default `10.88.0.0/16`,
    `10.99.100.53` on a `10.99.0.0/16` network, etc. — and was never a fixed
    value to begin with once that change landed. Fixed to describe the
    formula + default-subnet example instead of the stale literal.
    `DESIGN.md`'s mention was already correctly historical ("instead of the
    fixed 100.100.100.53") and needed no change; `TESTING.md`'s Results-log
    mention was likewise already a correct, dated finding and was left as-is.

    (2) **Invite CLI audit — the binary was right, the diagnosis was wrong.**
    TODO.md/TESTING.md's "attempt 1" finding claimed AGENTS.md documents
    invite flags (`--hostname`/`--expires`/`--qr`/`--reusable`/`list`/
    `revoke`) that the binary lacks. Reading `InviteAction` in `src/main.rs`
    and its dispatcher in `src/cli/invite.rs` shows all of them exist and
    match AGENTS.md's description. The actual bug: those flags belong to an
    explicit `create` subcommand variant, and clap will not parse
    subcommand-specific flags unless that subcommand word is present in
    argv — `torpedo invite testnet --hostname X` (no `create`) genuinely
    errors "unexpected argument", while `torpedo invite testnet create
    --hostname X` works. AGENTS.md's compact CLI reference omitted the
    `create` keyword, reading as if the flags attached to the bare `invite
    <net>` form; so did TESTING.md's Stage 3, Stage 12, and the hostname-change
    flow description. All four corrected to show `create` explicitly. The
    original TESTING.md finding was left in place (it accurately records what
    happened during that test run) with a follow-up note appended correcting
    the diagnosis, rather than rewritten, so the history of "what we thought

      write the same /tmp name), and the pre-filled GitHub issue title (both
      the crash and non-crash branches) + body header — all `rayfish` ->
      `torpedo`. Every bug report a user files currently mislabels itself.
    - `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.yml` + `feature_request.yml` — the
      user-facing issue forms said `rayfish` and used `ray <cmd>` examples.
      The load-bearing fix: bug_report told reporters logs live in
      `/var/log/rayfish` / `/Library/Logs/rayfish` — the WRONG directories

      <cmd>` throughout (issue templates are user-facing, so RENAME-011's
      source-comment carve-out does not apply).
    - `cliff.toml` — the changelog "Full Changelog" compare link was
      hardcoded to `github.com/rayfish/rayfish/compare/...`, rendering an
      upstream URL into this fork's published release notes. Repointed to the

      `CHANGELOG.md`'s header line ("All notable changes to Rayfish" ->
      "Torpedo"); the changelog *body* keeps its historical `ray <cmd>`
      entries (RENAME-011's deferred cosmetic class, not rewritten).

    critically, so a coding agent reading a comment does not emit a `ray <verb>`
    that no longer exists.

    Two parts:

    (1) **`ray <verb>` CLI/binary references (217 across 44 src files).** Every

    dead tail too is what makes the CON-010 gate viable (RENAME-011 had rejected

    names), `stingray`/`array` (substrings), `rayfish` (crate/preset), and the
    `"ray"` network-name wordlist entry. `ray-{os}-{arch}` upstream release
    asset names (hyphenated) are untouched.

    plane", `transport.rs` data-plane shape, `cli/firewall.rs` "the rayfish
    firewall", `cli/status.rs` header example, `invite.rs` `~/.config/rayfish`

    """REQUIREMENT-ID: RENAME-017

    Workstream D of the `ray`/`rayfish` audit: the e2e/bench harness under
    `tests/` (16 shell scripts + 11 READMEs). Unlike RENAME-016's src comments,
    this is a FUNCTIONAL fix — the scripts RUN against the deployed binary, and
    `deploy_all` uses `just deploy` (which installs the `torpedo` binary +
    service, no `ray` symlink), so every stale reference silently breaks or
    no-ops the test rather than being cosmetic. Confirmed-broken cases:

    - `on "$ip" 'ray <cmd>'` invocations (303 across tests/) → `command not
      found: ray`. Reworded to `torpedo` via the same lookbehind regex as
      RENAME-016 (`.ray` TLD, `ray-`, `rayfish` all excluded).
    - `reset_state` ran `systemctl stop rayfish; rm -rf /etc/rayfish
      /root/.config/rayfish` — a NO-OP against the `torpedo` service/paths, so
      state was never actually reset between runs. → torpedo.
    - `dns/run.sh` grepped `/etc/resolv.conf` for `"Added by rayfish"`, but the
      binary writes `# Added by torpedo` (`src/dns_config.rs`) — the direct-mode
      detection never matched. → torpedo.
    - `unpair` referenced the pkarr record `_rayfish_certgen`; the binary
      publishes `_torpedo_certgen` (`src/dht.rs`). Bench comment cited ALPN
      `rayfish/files/1`; real is `torpedo/files/1` (`src/transport.rs`). Invite
      helpers parsed CLI output for the literal `ray join`/`ray invite` strings
      the binary now prints as `torpedo`. → torpedo.
    - Cosmetic prose + bench comparison labels (`rayfish` vs direct, orchestrator
      comments) reworded uniformly; the `bench_pair "rayfish"` label arg and all
      its `get/ratio ... rayfish` lookups renamed together so the keying stays
      consistent.

    KEEP (unchanged): the `.ray` Magic-DNS TLD in every hostname/regex; and the
    `NAMES=(rayfish-*)` Scaleway instance labels (bare `rayfish`, retained — they
    are opaque ephemeral cloud-VM identifiers with an operational orphan cost and
    zero correctness benefit, the same rationale as keeping the crate name).
    Applied by skipping `NAMES=(` lines in the sweep.

    NOT in scope (separate pre-existing drift, flagged for follow-up): the
    `100.64.x.x` / `100.64.0.0/10` CGNAT range still cited in several bench/
    common.sh comments — a SUBNET doc-drift (default is now `10.88.0.0/16`),
    unrelated to this rename.

    Verified: `bash -n` parses every `tests/**/*.sh`; the full e2e run itself
    needs 3 provisioned cloud hosts and was NOT executed here.

    ENFORCEMENT: CON-010 extended to also scan `tests/` for the `ray <verb>`
    regex; CON-011 (below) curated-token gates the functional `rayfish`
    service/config/marker/record identity. Cosmetic prose is ungated (same
    reason as RENAME-016 part 2).

    Anti-regression gate for RENAME-017: the functional pre-fork `rayfish`
    identity must not reappear in the `tests/` harness. Curated token set
    (`systemctl {stop,start,restart} rayfish`, `/etc/rayfish`,
    `/root/.config/rayfish`, `Added by rayfish`, `_rayfish_certgen`,

    CON-008's approach (build/deploy tooling) but for the test harness, which no
