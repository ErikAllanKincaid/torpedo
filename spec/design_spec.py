# Specification for the `torpedo` fork of rayfish: make the overlay IPv4 subnet
# configurable at network-creation time instead of hardcoded to 100.64.0.0/10,
# and rebrand this fork's own identity (binary/service/paths/ALPN) away from
# rayfish so its traffic can never be confused with genuine rayfish traffic.
#
# libspec v9 note: each class's OWN docstring is what gets compiled into a
# stored component (base-class Jinja templates such as {{req_id}} are not
# inherited into a subclass docstring, because Python docstrings do not
# inherit). So each requirement/constraint ID is embedded literally in the
# first line of its docstring to stay visible and code-cross-referenceable,
# while req_id/constraint_id/enforcement_logic are also kept as class
# attributes for programmatic access (e.g. reconcile.py documentation).

    Fork rayfish so its overlay IPv4 subnet is configurable at network-creation
    time, instead of hardcoded to 100.64.0.0/10, so it can run alongside an
    already-active Tailscale client on the same host.

    Priority: high.
    User journey: create a network with a custom --subnet -> join it from a
    second machine also running Tailscale -> both machines reach each other over
    the fork's mesh while Tailscale keeps working unaffected on both.
    Acceptance: `torpedo create --subnet <cidr>` succeeds on a host with an
    active Tailscale client; a second host joins successfully; `torpedo status`
    on both shows a live peer; Tailscale connectivity is unaffected throughout.
